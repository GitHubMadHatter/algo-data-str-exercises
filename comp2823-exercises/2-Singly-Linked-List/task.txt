Try to implement the Singly Linked List data structure!

Each node contains a value and a link to the next node. It supports operations to set and get its element as well as operations to set and get the element it is linked to.

The Singly Linked List will contain Nodes from the Node class which you have created. It supports operations to get the first and last element, check before and after a particular node, insert an element before or after a particular node, remove a node, check size of list and also check if the list is empty.

Note: Although creating a doubly linked list data structure will fulfil the requirements for this task, it is best to try and create a singly linked list data structure for your learning purposes.
