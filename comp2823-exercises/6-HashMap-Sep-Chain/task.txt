This class implements a hashmap using separate chaining. Recall that separate chaining is a method of storing data in a hashmap where each cell of the table consists of a list of entries with an identical hashed key.

Inside the scaffold you can find all of the functions needed to be implemented. 

For more details, consult the lecture on hashing.

Good luck!
