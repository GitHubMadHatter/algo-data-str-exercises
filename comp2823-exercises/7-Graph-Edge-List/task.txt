Maintain a Edge List Graph implementation of a Undirected Graph ADT. The graph should have a list of vertices and a list of edges.

The vertex sequence holds:

Sequence of vertices

The edge sequence holds:

Sequence of edges

Each Edge object points to the two vertices it connects

Each vertex and edge should also hold one element. Note that you do NOT need to account for vertices or edges with duplicate elements.

You will only need to implement the functions in graphs.py since edge.py and vertex.py have already been filled out for you.
