This module aims to test your understanding of generic Trees. Each node in our tree:

Stores a single value

Has one parent (apart from the root)

Can hold any number of children, in any order. 

Further, each node will keep track of the height of its subtree, so make sure you update this!

When adding a new child to a node, add it to the end of the list of children.

In this suite of files, you will find scaffolds for node.py and tree.py. Please implement both files!

NB: Please consult the descriptions for each class method to determine what error cases you must account for!
