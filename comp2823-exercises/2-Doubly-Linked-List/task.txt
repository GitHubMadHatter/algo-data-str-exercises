Implement a doubly linked list using the provided scaffold below. A doubly linked list stores a list of nodes, each which has connections to the node which comes before and after.

The DoublyLinkedList class holds:
The size of the list
A reference to the front node
A reference to the last node

The Node class holds:
The value of the node
A reference to the node which goes after it
A reference to the node which goes before it

So, can you implement a doubly linked list and pass my devilish test cases? Find out now!
