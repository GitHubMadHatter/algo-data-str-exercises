Implement a hashmap using open addressing! You will use linear probing to do this.

Although a hashmap should be resized when its size approaches capacity (as per its load factor), you do not have to account for resizing. 

Assume all keys for the hashmap are integers. There is no restriction on what values may be.

A Defunct() class has been created and provided for you. You may use this if you wish, or you can use your own mechanisms for processing DEFUNCT.

NB: You do not need to implement the hash function, it has been given to you.
