AVL Trees are quite tree-cky!

Maintain an AVL Tree data structure - a binary search tree with the AVL property! The tree will contain nodes made using the node class in node.py.

For this task, there are no restrictions on what each node may hold. However, you do not need to create any specific comparator - this will be given in the test cases (Simply use the ._comparator variable).

You are required to implement this AVL Tree in the style that was shown in the lectures, including using dummy nodes (initialise with Node(None)) as the leaf nodes.

Read the descriptions and see lecture slides for any clarifications.

NB:  You do not have to implement node.py - it has been given!
